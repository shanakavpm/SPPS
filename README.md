# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System (SPPS)

This project is a high-performance research framework designed to predict student success. It provides deep analytical insights through **Statistical**, **Geographic**, and **Network Science** visualizations.

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   - 📊 **Charts**: Check the `figures/` folder (PNG).
   - 🗺️ **Interactive Maps**: Check the `outputs/` folder (HTML).
   - 📝 **Final Report**: Open `student_performance_research.ipynb`.

## 📂 Folder Breakdown

- **`main.py`**: The one-click script to run the whole pipeline.
- **`src/`**: The "brain" of the project (Data Loading, Processing, AI Models).
- **`figures/`**: Contains all 20+ generated charts (Learning curves, SHAP, Networks).
- **`outputs/`**: Contains interactive maps and the cleaned dataset for review.

## ✨ Key Capabilities

- **Smart Predictions**: Uses AI (XGBoost/Random Forest) to find at-risk students with 85%+ accuracy.
- **Why this result? (XAI)**: Uses SHAP and LIME to explain exactly which factors (like consistency or prior skill) influenced the score.
- **Multi-View Maps**: Visualizes regional educational disparities and skills dependencies.
