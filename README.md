# Student Performance Prediction System (SPPS)

This project provides a professional Machine Learning framework to predict student success. It is designed to handle both small and large datasets while providing clear, visual explanations for its predictions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. **Check reports**:
   Results and charts are saved in the `reports/` folder.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **`main.py`**: The main script to run the analysis.
* **`src/`**: Contains the core logic for data loading, processing, and models.
* **`data/`**: Folder for storing student datasets.
* **`reports/`**: Folder for all generated charts, XAI plots, and the final report.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Smart Predictions**: Uses advanced models like XGBoost and Random Forest.
* **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Uses SHAP and LIME to explain precisely why a student is predicted to be at risk.
* **Big Data Ready**: Optimized to process millions of student records efficiently.
* **Clean Code**: Built using modular design and SOLID principles.
